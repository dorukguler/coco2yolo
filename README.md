# Coco to YOLO Converter

This project is aimed at helping people convert their COCO (Common Objects in Context) annotations to the YOLO (You Only Look Once) format, which is widely used in object detection.

# Motivation

When training an object detection model with the COCO dataset, it is important to ensure that the bounding box format is compatible with the model's requirements. YOLO uses a specific format for its bounding boxes, and converting the COCO annotations to this format can be time-consuming and error-prone.

The main goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use tool for converting COCO annotations to the YOLO format, so that people can spend more time working on other aspects of their object detection projects.
